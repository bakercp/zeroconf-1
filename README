This is a release of RÃ©my Muller's zeroconf objects for MaxMSP. The
sources are here, including projects for OS X (Xcode 3.2) and Windows
(Visual Studio Express 2008).

Both builds are now current. The Xcode build creates Max externals as
universal binaries, compatible with OS X 10.4 (Tiger) onwards.

The directory `dist' contains prebuilt binaries.

Windows issues:

You need to install Apple's Bonjour for Windows (known as Bonjour
Print Services). Download link here:

The Zeroconf objects need a Visual C++ runtime library in order to
work. Download link here:

We've also taken the liberty of including the installer package here
(since it is, after all, "redistributable").

OS X issues:

I've made some slight mods to maxmspsdk.xcconfig - I plant
`sdk-build' at the same level as `zeroconf' (rather than one level
up). Also, there's an Info.plist for each project, rather than the
common Cycling '74 one (with Cycling '74's copyright notice and other
boilerplate).

For both builds, put the `c74support' directory from the SDK into the
same directory as `zeroconf' - I didn't want to put this into Github
since it's big and rather untidy.
