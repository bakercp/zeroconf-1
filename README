This is an initial release of RÃ©my Muller's zeroconf objects for
MaxMSP. The sources are here, including projects for OS X (Xcode) and
Windows (Visual Studio Express 2008). The Windows build is current;
the OS X build has not been exercised recently, or configured for this
file layout.

I've taken the liberty of enclosing binaries for Windows (in directory
`dist') since there's an immediate need for these.

Windows issues:

You need to install Apple's Bonjour for Windows (known as Bonjour
Print Services). Download link here:

The Zeroconf objects need a Visual C++ runtime library in order to
work. Download link here:

We've also taken the liberty of including the installer package here
(since it is, after all, "redistributable").

Main to-do's:

- Exercise (and, if necessary, fix) builds for OS X.

- Document directory structure and build procedure.
